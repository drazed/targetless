    Linux: locate and open your vendetta directory, usually ~/.vendetta/

If there isn't a plugins folder there already, create one. Unzip the plugin into the plugins folder, or if you already have it uncompressed put the folder containing the fils in plugins (remember to put the whole folder in, not the contents of the folder).
